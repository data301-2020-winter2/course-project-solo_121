## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

This data explains the medical cost of small population in the United States. Its columns are sample's age, sex, bmi, number of children or dependets, if the sample is smoker or not, region and medical costs. This data is used in the book introducing machine learning using R. So, I beliece this data was corrected for education of machine learning and public interest that how their health and life choices affect their medical costs. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Of course, I would like to see which column most affect to the medical cost. Also I am interested in finding how or which column affect to other or lead to unhealthy life. For example, what kind of person tend to smoke or in out og health range of BMI, and test if genders affect these facts. Especially I would like to see if single mothers are experiencing unhealthy habits or unhealthy body mass since it is stressful to take care her kids alone and support them financially. I am more interested in single mothers' health than single fathers health since mothers have to take care of her kids with experience of giving birth which may take time to recover and may have less chance to get a job and income than men do.
